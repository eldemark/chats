To set up this isolated, air-gapped network of computers running RHEL 9, with the specified features, follow these steps:

Hardware and Network Setup
Authentication Server:

A machine dedicated to authentication (can also serve as an NFS server for home directories).
Install and configure OpenLDAP or FreeIPA for authentication.
File Server:

A machine dedicated to serving files, ideally with NFS (Network File System) for easy access to home directories.
Ensure this server has ample storage for the user data.
Client Machines:

50 client machines, each running RHEL 9.
Network Infrastructure:

Use a network switch to connect all machines.
Ensure proper cabling and network configuration (e.g., static IPs).
Software Setup
Install RHEL 9:

Install RHEL 9 on all machines.
During installation, configure networking with static IP addresses.
Set Up Authentication Server:

OpenLDAP:
bash
Copy code
sudo dnf install -y openldap-servers openldap-clients
sudo systemctl enable --now slapd
sudo ldapadd -Y EXTERNAL -H ldapi:/// -f /etc/openldap/schema/cosine.ldif
sudo ldapadd -Y EXTERNAL -H ldapi:/// -f /etc/openldap/schema/nis.ldif
sudo ldapadd -Y EXTERNAL -H ldapi:/// -f /etc/openldap/schema/inetorgperson.ldif
FreeIPA:
bash
Copy code
sudo dnf install -y ipa-server
sudo ipa-server-install
Configure NFS for Home Directories:

On the file server:
bash
Copy code
sudo dnf install -y nfs-utils
sudo mkdir -p /export/home
sudo chown nobody:nobody /export/home
sudo chmod 777 /export/home
echo "/export/home  *(rw,sync,no_root_squash,no_subtree_check)" | sudo tee /etc/exports
sudo exportfs -a
sudo systemctl enable --now nfs-server
On each client machine:
bash
Copy code
sudo dnf install -y nfs-utils
sudo mkdir -p /home
echo "fileserver:/export/home /home nfs defaults 0 0" | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
sudo mount -a
Set Up Password-less SSH:

Generate SSH keys on all client machines and copy the public key to each machine:
bash
Copy code
ssh-keygen -t rsa -N "" -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
for i in {1..50}; do ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub user@client$i; done
Configure Centralized Authentication:

On each client machine, configure PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) and NSS (Name Service Switch) to use LDAP or FreeIPA:
bash
Copy code
sudo authconfig --enableldap --enableldapauth --ldapserver=ldapserver --ldapbasedn="dc=example,dc=com" --enablemkhomedir --update
Test and Verify:

Ensure each client machine can authenticate against the LDAP or FreeIPA server.
Verify that home directories are properly mounted via NFS.
Test SSH access between all client machines to ensure password-less login is working.
Security Considerations
Ensure all machines are in a physically secure location.
Regularly back up the authentication and file servers.
Monitor logs for any unusual activity, given the air-gapped nature of the network.
By following these steps, you will have a fully functional, isolated network meeting all specified requirements.
